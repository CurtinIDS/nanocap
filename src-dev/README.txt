Introduction
============

NanoCap provides both libraries and a standalone application for the construction 
of capped nanotubes of arbitrarily chirality and fullerenes of any radius. Structures 
are generated by constructing a set of optimal dual graph topologies which 
are subsequently optimised using a carbon interatomic potential. Combining 
this approach with a GUI featuring 3D rendering capabilities allows for the rapid 
inspection of physically sensible structures which can be used as input for 
molecular simulation.
